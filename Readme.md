# Design Patterns & SOLID Principles Learning Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my **Design Patterns & SOLID Principles Learning Repository**!  
This repo is a personal documentation of my journey learning essential software design concepts.  
It covers the **SOLID principles** and popular **design patterns** with detailed explanations and C++ code examples, illustrating both good and bad practices.

My goal is to provide clear notes and practical code to help anyone understand these concepts better and apply them in real-world projects.

## How to Use This Repo

### 1. Start with the `SOLID` Folder

The `SOLID` folder is where you will find the core principles of software design:

- For **each principle**, you will find:
  - A markdown file named `wtf_is_that?.md` (e.g., `Single_Responsibility\wtf_is_that?.md`), which contains **short notes and a brief explanation** of the principle.
  - Two C++ code files:
    - `bad_example.cpp` — shows a common **wrong or anti-pattern** usage.
    - `good_example.cpp` — demonstrates the **correct application** of the principle with clear code examples.

**How to study:**

- Read the `wtf_is_that?.md` to understand the theory.
- Review the `bad_example.cpp` to see what mistakes to avoid.
- Analyze the `good_example.cpp` to learn how to apply the principle correctly in code.
- Feel free to compile and run the code to see the difference in practice.

### 2. Move on to the `design_patterns` Folder

This folder dives deeper into behavioral and structural design patterns:

- Contains a detailed explanation file: `explain_to_me.md`  
  This file provides:
  - A thorough explanation of the pattern.
  - Discussion on why and when to use it.
  - Step-by-step walkthroughs of the example code.

- Two C++ example files for each pattern:
  - `without_example.cpp` — implementation **without** the pattern applied, showing potential issues or less flexible design.
  - `with_example.cpp` — implementation **with** the pattern applied, showing how it improves flexibility, maintainability, and design quality.

**How to study:**

- Start by reading the **what we are building** section inside the `explain_to_me.md` to get an overview about the code.
- Explore `without_example.cpp` and the **without_example** section in `explain_to_me.md` in parallel to see the baseline or common naive implementation.
- Explore and Study `with_example.cpp` with the **with_example** section in `explain_to_me.md` to understand how applying the pattern improves the design.
- Run and modify the code to solidify your understanding.

## Final Note

This repository is a **personal documentation** of my learning process.  
I hope that these notes, explanations, and code samples will be useful to anyone interested in mastering software design principles and patterns.  

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these concepts in your projects!
